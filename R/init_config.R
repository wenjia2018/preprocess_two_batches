# Because your code dumped a mass of variables (gene sets) into the global environment (and for other reasons) I have:
#   
#   merged init_config.R into init_define_gene_sets.R
# 
#   changed some naming conventions e.g. cole -> steve, so it matches my (bad) names
# 
#   made init_define_gene_sets into a function
#
#   added a procedure for the raw signatures (sum the counts)
#
#   the result is stored in the usual place with a reasonable name
